- Screw up the aluminum blocks on the acrylic chassis.
- Attach the wheels on the motor.

#### MOTOR BOARD
- Screw up the motor board on the acrylic chassis using m3 copper cylinders and m3 screws.

#### ULTRASONIC SENSOR
- Screw up the ultrasonic sensor to its board using m1 screws and nuts.

#### SERVO MOTOR
- Screw it up on its board using m2 screws and nuts.
- Attach and secure the servo motor with the ultrasonic sensor. 
- Screw up the board in the acrylic chassis using m3 screws and nuts.

#### IR RECEIVER MODULE
- Screw the IR Receiver Module using m2 screws and nuts into the acrylic chassis.

#### EXPANDING BOARD
- Screw up the expanding board on the acrylic chassis using m3 copper cylinders and m3 screws.
- Put the Arduino board at the top of the expanding board.
- Insert the bluetooth module into its place.

#### CELL BOX
- Screw the cell box into the chassis using m3 screws and nuts.
- Put 18659 Batteries.

#### UPPER CHASSIS
- Finally put the upper chassis above the lower one, then screw it up using m3 ones.

#### WIRING
- Follow the wiring diagram provided in the documentation.


## Arduino Installation

- Go to https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software to get the latest Arduino IDE. Install it on your computer. 
- Install Arduino Uno UNO driver. This can be done in the Windows Device Manager.
- Open the Arduino IDE. Select the corresponding board and port name.
- Upload the given code in this repository (MAIN CODE).


## Control (Android App)

- Install the .apk file in your android phone. 
- Connect it to bluetooth. 
- Use it as a remote to control the funtions and features of the robot car.


## Features

#### DIRECTION CONTROL
- Use the four direction buttons to move your robot car.

#### LINE TRACKING
- Make your own line track and place the robot. Navigate the line track botton and the robot will move along the track.

#### OBJECT AVOIDANCE
- Press the object avoidance button and the car will move until it encounters obstacles. It will automatically turn to the direction without obstacles to continue moving forwards when encountering obstacles.
